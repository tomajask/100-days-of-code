## Lecture 0

- Computer Science is about solving problems

Input -> [black box] -> output

The 'Black Box' is the computer science.


- How to represent an information to be understandable for a computer?

Computers understand binary system -> 0s and 1s.

- Emojis also have their representation in Unicode
- Images are numbers -> using RGB (Red, Green, Blue), defined as matrix of pixels (points), each of them is represented as a 3 numbers between 0 and 255
- GIFs and videos are just multiple images displayed very quickly to make an impression of move.

- Algorithm - step-by-step instruction to solve a problem

- Complexity of the algorithm
