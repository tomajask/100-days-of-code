# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Github repo setup, signed up for Harvard [CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work:**
