The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 16, 2020].

## Log

### R1D8

Continued with JS course -> objects & object references.

### R1D7

Continued with JS course -> functions.

### R1D6

Continued with JS course -> variable scopes.

### R1D4 & R1D5

Continued with JS course -> variables + control flow.

### R1D3

While I'm thinking of the project's topic for CS50 I started also [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript). I need to refresh my JavaScript knowledge. Many things have changed since I wrote JS code.

### R1D2
Finished watching the Lecture 0. Now, I need to implement a program accordingly to the requirements in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) which is basically a visual programming language.
I've also read an interesting article about renaming `master` branch to `main` in Github on [dev.to](https://dev.to/dandv/8-problems-with-replacing-master-in-git-2hck).
Plan for tomorrow is to start implementing a Scratch program. I just don't know yet what it should do :thinking_face:

### R1D1
Started watching Lecture 0 from [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). This guy is passionate about what he's doing. I wish my classes have looked like that... Everything he says has a perfect sense and it's put in a very logical way. I also like the visual representations of what he says. E.g. turning on and off the lighbulbs to represent the number in binary system. The knowledge from the Lecture 0 is very basic but I already feel that the entire course will be a great reminder for me of eveything I learned during my Computer Science studies. Let's see!

Notes from the Lecture 0 are [here](./notes/cs50/lecture_0.md).


### R1D0
Started the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Created this GH repo and signed up for [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). I joined the [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/100xcode/shared_invite/zt-eivg7x1x-wgNPDh7ug_u4GcUwZNT8Zg) and [discord](https://discord.gg/x7TGGTG).I've read the https://www.100daysofcode.com/ website and a few articles about the challenge ([1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/), [2](https://dev.to/hassansuhaib/what-i-learned-in-100daysofcode-d17), [3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-the-100daysofcode-challenge-make-coding-a-habit-4a655d8663fd/))
